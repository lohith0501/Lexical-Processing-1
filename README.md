# Lexical-Processing-1
Lexical processing are the common steps used in any text analytics/NLP projects. The steps involve tokenization (word,sentence,tweet,regex),stop words removal,canonicalisation(stemming (poster stemmer,snowball stemmer) and lemmatization (wordnet lemmatizer)). After performing all these we need Bag of words or TF-IDF techniques to understand important words in the documents.
